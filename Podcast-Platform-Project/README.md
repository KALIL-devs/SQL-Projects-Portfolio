PODCAST PLATFORM SQL PROJECT.

-- Project Overview
This project simulates a mini Podcast Platform database where users (listeners) can listen to various podcast episodes hosted by different hosts. 
The goal of the project is to showcase strong SQL skills in data modeling, querying, and analysis.

-- Database Schema

Tables:
hosts – Information about podcast hosts
episodes – Individual podcast episodes and metadata
listeners – Registered listeners
listens – Listener activities (episode listens)

Relationships:
One host can create many episodes
One listener can listen to many episodes

-- Key SQL Queries
1. Retrieve all episodes by a specific host
2. Identify top 3 most listened episodes
3. Rank hosts based on the number of episodes
4. Generate detailed listener behavior reports
5. List recent episodes uploaded in the last 30 days
6. Categorize episodes based on duration (Short / Medium / Long)
7. Find listeners who listened to multiple episodes

Each query demonstrates JOINs, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CASE and DATE functions.
